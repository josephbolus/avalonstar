summary: "This is the story of a guy and and the new year. The new year is treating said guy well, but he'd thought he'd take some time to give you some of his predictions on what the coming year might look like for design. Oh, and here take this sarcasm pill before you read it."

I don't have any. Go figure. So, **surprise me**. I like leaving things open ended.

Well, we live in a world of speculators, people who love to try and beat the market before anything's actually happened. My hope for this year is to be surprised, again and again. *Surprise the speculators* and send the *rumor mills packing*. Try something new, [like Canvas][1]. Break out of that shell. Thrown on [some CSS3][2] with a [sprinkle of HTML5][3]. [Leave IE6 behind for good][4].

Oh, I can make one prediction though, albeit personal. You'll be seeing [those eggrolls soon][5] and a bunch more. I'm sure that'll please [certain eggroll addicts][6].
