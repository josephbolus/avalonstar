summary: "This is the story of a guy and a conference. At said conference, he saw a keynote by some guy at Flickr. The keynote was about how Django sucked. But one thing caught said guy's eye, the fact that Django needed a mascot. Read on to experience the ensuing pony-fest."

As many of you know, [DjangoCon][1] came to a close yesterday. Long story short, one of my favorite conferences ever. The laughs, memories, connections and available knowledge -- endless. Soon, there'll be videos of all the talks for all to enjoy, but I couldn't help acting on one of my favorite talks of the first night, [Cal Henderson's][2] [keynote on why he hates Django.][8]

In it, amongst other things, he talked about how Django needed a mascot. One that was *awesome* and had *magical powers*. Well, somewhere inside my head, I agreed. Since the pony seems to have much historical significance within the Django project, I give you the logo for "the web framework for *ponies* with *magical powers*." [Django is now awesome.][3]

[Wilson][4], I *expect* the redesign tomorrow. ;)

**Update**: Now in green by popular demand!

**Update 2**: To my amazement there [is now a website dedicated][5] the lovable pony. Once I find out who made it, I'll be sure to talk to them about what my plan was for shirts. :)

**Update 3**: [I think I found him.][6]

**Update 4**: So the pony's magic didn't stay unexplained for long [as investigators found out][7] what really powers our beloved Django pony.

**Update 5**: Updated the post with the video of Cal's keynote. Watch it, now.
