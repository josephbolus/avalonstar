summary: "This is the story of a guy and his process. His process? Well, while there isn't much of one, it's really hard for things to become part of the process. As a little break from Revyver week, he's wondering how you're able to. "

While I'm spending my first night in [Park City][1], Utah, I had a thought at the front of my mind. Since I've been doing quite well with posting, why stop? :) Don't worry, this'll be short. *You'll be doing the talking this time!*

## Bryan's got problems. Don't say anything.
To start, I'll just say it's deathly hard to get anything to assimilate into my daily life. Web applications, software, anything. At best, I'll use a program or about 2 weeks and then all of a sudden forget about it. Let's take [Twitter][2] for instance, the only reason I've been able to keep up with it is because of the social utility involved. Alright, bad example.

Oh here's one. **iCal**. I *love* it, but I can't seem to remember to use it whenever I have a date to take note of. I've tried on multiple occasions to just keep the it open while I work and I always find a way to command-Q it. Another example. See how "Site of the Moment" is missing? Even though it was **right there**, I was never able to keep up with it.

## So, here's the question.
How hard is it for you to incorporate new programs, services or processes into your daily life? How long did it take? If something eventually falls out of favor, why and how long does it take?

Maybe I can understand my own "problem," by seeing your reasoning. :)
