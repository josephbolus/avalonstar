I'm 4 episodes into Vlogalonstar—3 if you don't count the introduction.

I've changed the angles around, I still want an DSLR (depth-of-field is sexy), I've switched from Final Cut Pro to Premiere and back to Final Cut Pro. But you know what, none of that matters if you can't ship a video.

(I'm using an iPhone, by the way.)

Two weeks ago, that happened. Three times. I had one relatively serious video where one of the segments didn't record any sound. After the frustration passed, I made a relatively silly video answering questions off of Formspring and the iPhone overheated halfway through and never saved the segment.

After _that_ frustration passed—desperately wanting to actually record _something_—I went to Twitter for questions. Thankfully! I got a few, recorded and nothing terrible happened. So here you go, questions on _passion_, _drive_ and the _new_ [Vlogalonstar Live][1].
