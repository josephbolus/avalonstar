I have a confession to make.

**I can't write blog posts this short.**

I have no idea why but I feel the need that if I'm going to post something, it has to be longer than 4 lines in my WordPress edit box. I think at first it was because if I didn't do that, my design would break. And if you've been with me for some time, you know how I get when my design breaks.

Anyway, now since I have 600 readers who I don't want annoyed at me, I wouldn't want to present them with a one-liner in their news reader. One of the reasons I had changed my feeds to full was that if I did have a slim post with an image, then you'd see the image. I worry too much about these things. But I did want to get your input. What's your view of short versus long posts? Are people that write short posts just too lazy to write long ones? Or is there a stigma about writing long posts and boring the user?
