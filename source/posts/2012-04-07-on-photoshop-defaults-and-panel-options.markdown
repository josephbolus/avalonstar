You know, it figures that the first episode of the hastily named "Vlogalonstar" would be on Photoshop. This, my friends, is my first real test at the new format. More so than the first video, this was both a joy and a challenge to make.

I really feel that if I keep at this, something good will come out of it. That said, I hope you enjoy it! (o^_^)b

And now for an errata. I had said in the inaugural video that the [Vlogbrothers][1] had **5 minutes** per video to keep their audience's attention before being "punished." That was incorrectâ€”the correct number being **4**. So with that in mind, I managed to fit what I needed to into _3:54_.
