If you're seeing this, then you're getting a first look at what will be the next version of Avalonstar, number twenty-six, _Redemption_. It is, as of today, unfinished. But as they say, _"release early, release often"_.

Enjoy what you see, even though there's not a lot of it. You can scrub back and forth between this and my 242 other posts. Hopefully you'll scrub back far enough to see what I consider is the crown jewel of this reworking. Expect much explanation in the coming days...

... I just have, uh, a few more designs to finish off. :)
